## Project Title
**Blockchain-based Biometric Authentication**

## Project Description
This project implements a secure biometric authentication system on the blockchain. The smart contract manages the project details, such as the title and description, ensuring that they are stored in a decentralized and immutable manner. The system aims to offer a secure and transparent mechanism for integrating biometric authentication on the blockchain.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to leverage blockchain technology to create an immutable and secure framework for biometric authentication. This would improve the trustworthiness and reliability of biometric data handling, making it possible to authenticate users without compromising their privacy or data security.

## Future Scope
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: Integrating decentralized identity systems to store and authenticate users securely.
- **Biometric Data Storage**: Exploring encrypted biometric data storage solutions on the blockchain for user verification purposes.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Adding layers of authentication like password verification along with biometric checks for extra security.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Storage**: Ensures project details (title and description) are stored securely on the blockchain.
- **Owner-Only Access**: Only the contract owner can update the project details, providing centralized control over critical data.
- **Event Logging**: Emits events when the project details are updated, providing a transparent and auditable trail of changes.
- **Immutability**: Once deployed, the contract ensures that the project details are immutable unless updated by the authorized owner.
